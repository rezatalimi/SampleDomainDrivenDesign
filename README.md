# Sample Domain Driven Design (DDD)
DDD Architecture Sample Code
This project is a small code sample demonstrating the implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. In this example, an effort has been made to adhere to design principles at both High-Level and Low-Level.

The project structure is designed to maintain proper separation between the Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers.
